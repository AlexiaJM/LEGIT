Description: Constructs genotype x environment interaction (GxE) models where
    G is a weighted sum of genetic variants (genetic score) and E is a weighted
    sum of environments (environmental score) using the alternating optimization algorithm 
    by Jolicoeur-Martineau et al. (2017) <arXiv:1703.08111>. Alternating optimization is 
    an iterative process where the genetic score weights, the environmental score weights, 
    and the main model parameters are estimated in turn assuming the other parameters to 
    be constant. This approach has greatly enhanced predictive power over traditional GxE 
    models which include only a single genetic variant and a single environmental 
    exposure. Gene x gene interactions (GxG) and environment x environment interactions 
    (ExE) can be incorporated into the genetic and environmental scores. Any standard 
    model formula can be used, it doesn't have to be a two-way interaction model. 
    Although this approach was made for GxE modelling, the genetic score doesn't need to 
    contain genetic variables and the environmental score doesn't need to contain 
    environmental variables, therefore this approach is highly flexible.
