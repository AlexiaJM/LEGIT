\title{Latent Environmental & Genetic InTeraction (LEGIT) model}
\usage{
LEGIT(data, genes, env, formula, start_genes = NULL, start_env = NULL,
  eps = 0.001, maxiter = 100, family = gaussian, ylim = NULL,
  print = TRUE, crossover = NULL, crossover_fixed = FALSE,
  reverse_code = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of the dataset to be used.}

\item{genes}{data.frame of the variables inside the genetic score \emph{G} (can be any sort of variable, doesn't even have to be genetic).}

\item{env}{data.frame of the variables inside the environmental score \emph{E} (can be any sort of variable, doesn't even have to be environmental).}

\item{formula}{Model formula. Use \emph{E} for the environmental score and \emph{G} for the genetic score. Do not manually code interactions, write them in the formula instead (ex: G*E*z or G:E:z).}

\item{start_genes}{Optional starting points for genetic score (must be the same length as the number of columns of \code{genes}).}

\item{start_env}{Optional starting points for environmental score (must be the same length as the number of columns of \code{env}).}

\item{eps}{Threshold for convergence (.01 for quick batch simulations, .0001 for accurate results).}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations.}

\item{family}{Outcome distribution and link function (Default = gaussian).}

\item{ylim}{Optional vector containing the known min and max of the outcome variable. Even if your outcome is known to be in [a,b], if you assume a gaussian distribution, predict() could return values outside this range. This parameter ensures that this never happens. This is not necessary with a distribution that already assumes the proper range (ex: [0,1] with binomial distribution).}

\item{print}{If FALSE, nothing except warnings will be printed. (Default = TRUE).}

\item{crossover}{If not NULL, estimates the crossover point of \emph{E} using the provided value as starting point (To test for diathesis-stress vs differential susceptibility).}

\item{crossover_fixed}{If TRUE, instead of estimating the crossover point of E, we force/fix it to the value of "crossover". (Used when creating a diathes-stress model) (Default = FALSE).}

\item{reverse_code}{If TRUE, after fitting the model, the genes with negative weights are reverse coded (ex: g1_new = 1 - g1). It assumes that the original coding is in [0,1]. The purpose of this option is to prevent genes with negative weights which cause interpretation problems (ex: depression normally decrease attention but with a negative genetic score, it increase attention). Warning, using this option with GxG interactions could cause nonsensical results since GxG could be inverted. (Default = FALSE).}

\item{warn}{If FALSE, remove certain warnings. (Default = TRUE).}
}
\value{
Returns an object of the class "LEGIT" which is list containing, in the following order: a glm fit of the main model, a glm fit of the genetic score, a glm fit of the environmental score, a list of the true model parameters (AIC, BIC, rank, df.residual, null.deviance) for which the individual model parts (main, genetic, environmental) don't estimate properly and the formula.
}
\description{
Constructs a generalized linear model (glm) with a weighted latent environmental score and weighted latent genetic score using alternating optimization.
