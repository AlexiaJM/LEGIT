#' @title Gene-Environment correlation estimation and testing (This is only relevant for GxE models) [Experimental feature]
#' @description Estimates the gene-environment correlation (rGE). If there is an important correlation between G and E, the model is still valid prediction-wise but the interpretation is affected as the question becomes is it really a GxE or a GxG since E is partially caused by G. To account for this, we remove the influence of G on E (If E = b0 + b1*G + e, we use E_resid = E - b1*G) and refit the model to see if the model parameters changed. This new environment variable (E_resid) is now completely uncorrelated with G. This does not account for passive rGE but only active rGE.
