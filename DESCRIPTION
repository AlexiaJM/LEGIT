Description: Constructs genotype x environment interaction (GxE) models where
    G is a weighted sum of genetic variants (genetic score) and E is a weighted
    sum of environments (environmental score). This approach has greatly enhanced
    predictive power over traditional GxE models which include only a single genetic
    variant and a single environmental exposure. Gene x gene interactions (GxG)
    and environment x environment interactions (ExE) can be incorporated into the
    genetic and environmental scores. Any standard model formula can be used, it
    doesn't have to be a two-way interaction model. Although this approach was made
    for GxE modelling, the genetic score doesn't need to contain genetic variables
    and the environmental score doesn't need to contain environmental variables,
    therefore this approach is highly flexible. A paper discussing the method used
    for estimating the weights should be released as pre-print and sent for peer-
    review before Summer 2017.
