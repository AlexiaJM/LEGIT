LEGIT v1.3.2 (Release date: 2020-03-05)
==============

Changes:

* Fixed bug in Elastic Net variable selection; it was wrongly including the intercept when L1-normalizing the weights of the main model. This may changes results slightly.

LEGIT v1.3 (Release date: 2019-07-16)
==============

Changes:

* Added Elastic Net variable selection. This is much faster and better than other methods.

LEGIT v1.2.1 (Release date: 2018-02-07)
==============

Changes:

* Documentation fixes
* Bug with missing data in LEGIT fixed
* Model fits of GxE testing are now ordered from best to worse
* Added Plot.LEGIT option to change label
* Changed rescale option in LEGIT to use the range [-1,1] rather than [0,1]. Why? Because if you had negative weights, the score variable was not garanteed to be in [0,1] but with [-1,1], it always is going to be in [-1,1].
* Updated vignettes
* Small other fixes
