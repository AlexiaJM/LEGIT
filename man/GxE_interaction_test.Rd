  criterion = "BIC", start_genes = NULL, start_env = NULL, eps = 0.001,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of the dataset to be used.}

\item{genes}{data.frame of the variables inside the genetic score \emph{G} (can be any sort of variable, doesn't even have to be genetic).}

\item{env}{data.frame of the variables inside the environmental score \emph{E} (can be any sort of variable, doesn't even have to be environmental).}

\item{formula_noGxE}{formula WITHOUT \emph{G} or \emph{E} (y ~ covariates). \emph{G} and \emph{E} will automatically be added properly based on the hypotheses tested.}

\item{crossover}{A tuple containting the minimum and maximum of the environment used as crossover point of \emph{E} used in the vantage sensitivity and diathesis-stress models. Instead of providing two number, you can also write c("min","max") to automatically choose the expected minimum or maximum of the environmental score which is calculated based on the min/max of the environments and the current weights.}

\item{reverse_code}{If TRUE, after fitting the model, the genes with negative weights are reverse coded (ex: \eqn{g_{rev}} = 1 - \eqn{g}). It assumes that the original coding is in [0,1]. The purpose of this option is to prevent genes with negative weights which cause interpretation problems (ex: depression normally decreases attention but with a negative genetic score, it increases attention). Warning, using this option with GxG interactions could cause nonsensical results since GxG could be inverted. Also note that this may fail with certain models (Default=FALSE).}

\item{rescale}{If TRUE, the environmental variables are automatically rescaled to the range [0,10] using (value - min)/(max - min) * 10. This greatly improves interpretability (Default=FALSE).}

\item{boot}{Optional number of bootstrap samples. If not NULL, we use bootstrap to find the confidence interval of the crossover point. This provides more realistic confidence intervals. Make sure to use a bigger number (>= 1000) to get good precision; also note that a too small number could return an error ("estimated adjustment 'a' is NA").}

\item{criterion}{Criterion used to assess which model is the best. It can be set to "AIC", "AICc", "BIC", "cv", "cv_AUC", "cv_Huber" (Default="BIC").}

\item{start_genes}{Optional starting points for genetic score (must be the same length as the number of columns of \code{genes}).}

\item{start_env}{Optional starting points for environmental score (must be the same length as the number of columns of \code{env}).}

\item{eps}{Threshold for convergence (.01 for quick batch simulations, .0001 for accurate results).}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations.}

\item{family}{Outcome distribution and link function (Default = gaussian).}

\item{ylim}{Optional vector containing the known min and max of the outcome variable. Even if your outcome is known to be in [a,b], if you assume a Gaussian distribution, predict() could return values outside this range. This parameter ensures that this never happens. This is not necessary with a distribution that already assumes the proper range (ex: [0,1] with binomial distribution).}

\item{cv_iter}{Number of cross-validation iterations (Default = 5).}

\item{cv_folds}{Number of cross-validation folds (Default = 10). Using \code{cv_folds=NROW(data)} will lead to leave-one-out cross-validation.}

\item{folds}{Optional list of vectors containing the fold number for each observation. Bypass cv_iter and cv_folds. Setting your own folds could be important for certain data types like time series or longitudinal data.}

\item{Huber_p}{Parameter controlling the Huber cross-validation error (Default = 1.345).}

\item{id}{Optional id of observations, can be a vector or data.frame (only used when returning list of possible outliers).}

\item{classification}{Set to TRUE if you are doing classification (binary outcome).}

\item{seed}{Seed for cross-validation folds.}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing 1) the six models ordered from best to worse (vantage sensitivity WEAK/STRONG, diathesis-stress WEAK/STRONG, differential susceptibility WEAK/STRONG) and 2) a data frame with the criterion, the crossover, 95\% coverage of the crossover, whether the crossover 95\% interval is within the observable range and the percentage of observations below the crossover point in order from best to worst based on the selected criterion. Models not within the observable range should be rejected even if the criterion is slightly better. An extremely low percentage of observations below the crossover point is also evidence toward diathesis-stress. Note that we assume that the environmental score is from bad to good but if this is not the case, then the models labelled as "diathesis-stress" could actually reflect vantage sensitivity and vice-versa. If outcome is Good-to-Bad: C=min(E) is diathesis-stress, C=max(E) is vantage sensitivity. If outcome is Bad-to-Good: C=max(E) is diathesis-stress, C=min(E) is vantage sensitivity.

\description{
Testing of the GxE interaction using the competitive-confirmatory approach adapted from Belsky, Pluess et Widaman (2013). Reports the different hypotheses (diathesis-stress, vantage-sensitivity, or differential susceptibility), assuming or not assuming a main effect for \emph{E} (WEAK vs STRONG) using the LEGIT model.
